Free Market is an e-commerce platform developed using technologies such as React and Firebase, among others.

The application allows users to view a list of gastronomic products on the main screen, filter them by category, and view the details of selected products. This includes the ability to increase or decrease the quantity of products according to their stock availability

Users can add products to their shopping cart and then fill out a checkout form that is fully validated before completing the transaction.
